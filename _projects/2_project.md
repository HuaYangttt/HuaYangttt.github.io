From **Sep 2024 â€“ Dec 2024**, I led a **4-person team** to develop a full-stack **movie recommendation web app**, mentoring junior developers and ensuring smooth collaboration.  

We designed and optimized machine learning models (**SVM, CNN, XGBoost**) for personalized movie recommendations. The project also integrated modern software engineering practices such as **issue tracking, pull requests, and CI/CD automation**.  

**Tech Stack:** CSS, HTML, CI/CD, SVM, CNN, XGBoost, MySQL
