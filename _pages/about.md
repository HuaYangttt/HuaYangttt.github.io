Hua Yang is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University, where he began his doctoral studies in August 2024. He earned his M.S. in Computer Science from South China University of Technology and his B.S. in Electronic Engineering from Central South University. His research interests lie in the intersection of trustworthy AI and software engineering, with a particular focus on securing large language models for code (LLMs4code) from both model and data perspectives.

<!-- Yang has industry experience as a Machine Learning Intern at the AI Large Model for Intelligent Cognition Center, Pazhou Lab, where he contributed to award-winning multimodal systems and scalable enterprise LLM-powered platforms.  -->

Yang has extensive research experience in trustworthy AI. During his time as a Machine Learning Intern at the AI Large Model for Intelligent Cognition Center, Pazhou Lab, he worked on trustworthy AI and published two papers in this area, including one in IEEE BIBM 2023 and another in IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing. His current research investigates how to better protect privacy and security during the training of LLMs4code.

Yang also actively contributes to the research community, serving as a reviewer for leading conferences and journals, including ICSE and IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing.
